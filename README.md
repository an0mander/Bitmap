This code took in commands from from a text file,parsed each line of the commands in the text file,
identified what command to use and using the the functions in the color, image and bitmapfile classes
outputed a bitmap file image that corresponded to the image of the Penn State University mascot.
Unfortunately, I can't seem to upload the text file containing the commands or the image.
